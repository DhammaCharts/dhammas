# Mental Formation

>“Suppose, bhikkhus, that a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, would take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There he would see the trunk of a large plantain tree, straight, fresh, without a fruit-bud core. He would cut it down at the root, cut off the crown, and unroll the coil. As he unrolls the coil, he would not find even softwood, let alone heartwood. A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial. For what substance could there be in the trunk of a plantain tree? So too, bhikkhus, whatever kind of volitional formations there are, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a bhikkhu inspects them, ponders them, and carefully investigates them. As he investigates them, they appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial. For what substance could there be in volitional formations?"

3 Kammas

>“Intention, I tell you, is kamma. Intending, one does kamma by way of body, speech, and intellect."
>[AN 6.63](https://suttacentral.net/an6.63/en/thanissaro?reference=none&highlight=false)

>“And what, bhikkhus is new kamma? Whatever action one does now by body, speech, or mind. This is called new kamma.
>And what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of kamma? When one reaches liberation through the cessation of bodily action, verbal action, and mental action, this is called the cessation of kamma."
>[SN 35.146](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.146/en/bodhi?reference=none&highlight=false)

>"Bhikkhus, this body is not yours, nor does it belong to others. It is old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt."
>[SN 12.37](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.37/en/bodhi?reference=none&highlight=false)

>"Bhikkhus, there are these three bases of meritorious activity. What three? The basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving; the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behavior; and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in meditative development."
