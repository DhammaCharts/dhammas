>“Intention, I tell you, is kamma. Intending, one does kamma by way of **body, speech**, and **intellect."**
>[AN 6.63](https://suttacentral.net/an6.63/en/thanissaro?reference=none&highlight=false)

>“And what, bhikkhus is new kamma? Whatever action one does now by body, speech, or mind. This is called new kamma.
>And what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of kamma? When one reaches liberation through the cessation of bodily action, verbal action, and mental action, this is called the cessation of kamma."
>[SN 35.146](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.146/en/bodhi?reference=none&highlight=false)

>"Bhikkhus, this body is not yours, nor does it belong to others. It is old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt."
>[SN 12.37](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.37/en/bodhi?reference=none&highlight=false)
